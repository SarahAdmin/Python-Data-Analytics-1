Interviewers were professional, respectful, friendly at all times which helped to reduce a little bit of the interview nerves and encourage better answers from myself - good balance between structured questions and free flowing conversation. Interviewers always left time for me to ask questions at the end of each round and gave clear, honest answers.

Liked the fact that I also spoke with another delivery manager and someone from engineering during the process. 

Communication excellent, Jake and interviewers (Stu) followed up quickly after each round to schedule the next one and were accommodating of my existing work schedule and personal commitments. 

Big thanks to Jake for connecting on LinkedIn, answering my initial questions pre interview process and for generally being really helpful and friendly during the offer stage. 

Very much looking forward to joining CurrencyCloud. Good work. ",4 - Satisfied

There was the option to combine some sessions to reduce the number of different sessions required, but I wasn't personally able to book more than one at a time for the most part due to constraints on my own time or availability of interviewers. 

One potential suggestion would be to try to potentially combine some of the sessions by default, potentially by shortening the time required for each as I typically found there was a quite a bit of time at the end for questions. For example, a couple of the technical interviews could be combined, or the last two. It may be particularly feasible if one interviewer is able to cover multiple areas, though this has the effect that the candidate gets to meet fewer potential colleagues.",5 - Very satisfied,5 - Very satisfied,0 - Prefer not to answer,5 - Very satisfied,5 - Very satisfied,"Overall, the interview process was very positive, touched on a considerable number of different areas and gave me a lot of chances to ask questions.

My answer to the first question around the application process is ""prefer not to answer"" as I was referred by an existing employee, so I managed to bypass most of the application process.",0 - Prefer not to answer
